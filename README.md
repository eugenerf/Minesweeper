# Minesweeper
A Windows classic Minesweeper game clone. 

There are two Projects in this Repository: MineSweeper and SetupMineSweeper.

## MineSweeper Project
The MineSweeper game Project. Made with MS Visual Studio 2015. Game code is fully documented.
UI is made using WindowsForms. Game Settings are saved using SOAP serialization.
In code I used some patterns (such as Prototype and Singleton). I've done it just to better understand them and their implementation.

## SetupMineSweeper Project
An InstallShield Wizard installer project. Made with MS Visual Studio 2015.
